# This script only really works if you have set the time over WiFi using NTP.
# Timezones in North America switch to Daylight Savings Time at 2AM on the Second Sunday in March. 
# They switch to Standard Time at 2AM on the First Sunday in November.
#
# Usage:
#   import time
#   from timezone import tz, isDST
#   time.localtime(tz())           # Convert UTC now to CDT/CST
#   time.localtime(tz(679791859))  # Convert UTC timestamp to CDT/CST
#   isDST()                        # Is UTC now Daylight Savings Time?
#   isDST(679791859)               # Is UTC timestamp Daylight Savings Time?
#

UTC_Offset_ST  = -6  # CST
UTC_Offset_DST = -5  # CDT

import time
def tz(debug_time=None, format='time'):
    if debug_time is not None:
        t = debug_time  # UTC Unix Timestamp for testing 
    else:
        t = time.time()
    year = time.localtime(t)[0]
    start = time.mktime((year, 3,(14-(int(5*year/4+1))%7),2,0,0,0,0))  # 2AM the Second Sunday in March
    end   = time.mktime((year,11,( 7-(int(5*year/4+1))%7),2,0,0,0,0))  # 2AM the  First Sunday in November
    if format == 'time':
        return t + (3600 * UTC_Offset_ST) if t < start or t > end else t + (3600 * UTC_Offset_DST)
    elif format == 'bool':
        return False if t < start or t > end else True
    else:
        return None
